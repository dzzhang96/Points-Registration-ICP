# Points-Registration-ICP

Orbital Rim Registration Software V1.0

A simple software for points registration based on VTK7.0 and Qt5.0. (you can cmake itðŸ˜€)The basic algorithm is ICP, the number of iterations is set to 50. 

The upper left window renders the stable STL while the upper right window can be input several STLs for transformation.

You can either registrate by right clicking (to get points) on STL:

or registrate directly by point clouds:

You can also save the matrix and the coordinates of points.
